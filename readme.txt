This plugin converts Greek characters in post, page and term slugs to Latin characters. (Greeklish). 

== Description ==

Greek text turns into a long series of non-readable symbols when appeared in URLs, which makes it look bad. This plugin solves the problem and it just works! This plugin converts Greek characters in post, page and term slugs to Latin characters. (Greeklish). The title of an article in Greek "https://www.problogger.gr/κατασκευή-και-προώθηση-ιστοσελίδων" will be "https://www.problogger.gr/kataskevi-proothisi-istoselidon".
