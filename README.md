# Greeklish-permalink-wordpress
Convert greek characters to latin (greeklish). Greek text turns into a long series of non-readable symbols when appeared in URLs, which makes it look bad. This plugin solves the problem and it just works! 
I appreciate your taking the time to visit my Greek site: [προώθηση ιστοσελίδων](https://www.problogger.gr/proothisi-istoselidon/), and Bulgarian blog [SEO услуги](https://blog7.org/seo-optimizacia-saitove/). Thank you.
